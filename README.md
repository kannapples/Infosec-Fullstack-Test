## Instructions for setting up server

To start the server open a terminal window on unix/linux based systems and change
directory to the project root. Then execute this command:

```
  ./server
```

I used the template server so there should be no problems running the server command. 

After starting the server go to:

```
http://localhost:8765/index.html  
```
